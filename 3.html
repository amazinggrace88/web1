  <h2>How to invest money</h2>
  <br> Investing is more important than saving. Because saving keeps your money but investing grow your money. There are so many ways to invest your money. Property, gold, currency, stocks, bonds.. etc. You can choose what you want and go for it. The way to grow your money as much as possible is put your money in stock market. However, I recommand you to put your money to index market stocks rather than individual company stocks. The reason is simple. Always stock markets goes up.
